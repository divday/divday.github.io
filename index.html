                Our team, a committee from the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists (HACS) and Association of
                Black Computer Scientists
                (ABCS), is a focused diverse group of 8 University Of Texas Computer Science students. Our committee is
                supported
                by the Computer Science Department, HACS, and ABCS. Our intention is to create a conference, Div Day,
                to
                give students in our community the opportunity to have a unique empowering experience so that they can
                strive
                for a strengthened diverse community and become leaders to enact change in the STEM workforce.
